Aloha Mai!

'OhanaGPT is an open-source project made by Tyler Alika and Amy Ka'elehiwa Gee. 
This is a passion and portfolio project with the goal of showcasing transformer technology for genealogical research.

The goal of this procject is to predict parents of anccestors to serve as an aid in research as well as to show competency in transformer neural netowrks, web development, and community building.

This project will remain fiecely simple to keep development but any community support is welcome. The server is currently hosted on a local computer to maintain privacy of users data. 

Backend and machine learning develoment is lead by ikaikaalika and front end is by Kaelehiwa11.

Since this is a passion project, bug fixes will be slow.

ML Documentation and methdologies will be in an accompanied PDF.
